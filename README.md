# Robot-Challenge-Final-Attempt
## Welcome to a JR DEV attempt at making a Robot that could navigate a web page!

All you have to do is clone down this repo and open the code (for me it opens in VSCode).
When you see the little button above the "public static void main" that says "run", click it.
The program should open a browser, navigate to the HPA challenge site and begin trying to run
through the boxes by making key presses.

### Prerequisites

1. A computer
2. Visual Studio
3. Java

### Installing

Clone down this repository:
git@github.com:MelanieJaneBond/Robot-Challenge-Final-Attempt.git
Follow the Java Install instructions here:

Then, open the cloned files in your Visual Studio Code and click
the "run" button that appears above the "public static void main"
